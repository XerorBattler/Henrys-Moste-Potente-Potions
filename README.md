# Henry’s Moste Potente Potions
*By Omricon*  
Version: 1.1
## Introduction
These recipes are made to give you the best quality potions, while streamlining the brewing process as much as possible. That makes it easier to brew them repeatedly without needing to spend time on unnecessary steps.

It turns out that a lot of the waiting for the brewing process isn't required, so I have cut them out where the game doesn't care (in some few recipes the time is required, and the instructions will show this). Just follow the steps to the dot, and you should get the best quality possible with the maximum amount possible.

These potions were created with level 30 in alchemy, so it might be more challenging to achieve top quality at lower levels of alchemy as from my testing, timing precision requirements differ depending on your skill level. If you are experiencing lower quality potions, try to adjust the formula depending on 
Henry's remarks about the potion (lower/increase the number of times you blow the bellows, pre-prep the ingredients into the mortar or don’t, etc.).

I have used the word *Add* whenever something is added to a **Cauldron**, and the word *Put* whenever something is added to a **Mortar** or **Dish**. The text is bolded in such a way that it should be enough to simply read the bolded text. These choices are made to make it easier to follow the steps listed.

### Dried herbs
* Without **Dark Arts Apprentice** active, you may use up to 66% dried herbs without it being considered a loss in quality. At least one herb must be fresh (i.e. not charcoal or boar's tusk).
* With **Dark Arts Apprentice** active, you may replace all herbs with dried herbs without it being considered a loss in quality.

Testing of dried herbs was done with Mintha perfume and dollmaker poison, where you can get away with 3/5 and 2/3 herbs being dried, resulting in a 66% dried/fresh ratio.

Perks
- **Secret of Secrets** unlocks *Henry's level* of potions and poisons. However, not all alchemy recipes have levels. This guide will always deliver the best quality.
- **Secret of Matter / II** unlocks additional potions when brewing. Together they will give x6 potions and poisons, x8 soap, and x18 powders.
- **Secret of Equilibrium / II** is not required. The following guide does not require those perks to achieve maximum quality. If you have taken one of these perks, you may create and consume *Lethean Water* to reset all your perks.
- **Dark Arts Apprentice** allows you to use only dried herbs if you brew the potion within 00:00–04:30. It also allows you to get up to one mistake without lowering the quality of the final product. However, it will lower the amount. Therefore it is recommended to not cut corners to get the full amount.

### Recognition
- [Lazarus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VstG120CoPM) - Origin for the idea of not following the recipes directly
- [RandomedXY](https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1ir7sw7/comment/md7uk9k/) - Even faster Saviour Schnapps recipe which helped me do further testing to improve the rest of the recipes
